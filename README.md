## Overview
The ClimateTrackr project is a comprehensive system designed to monitor and track climate data such as temperature and humidity. It consists of the following components:

- ClimateTrackr Server: A .NET Core Web API responsible for authentication, data ingestion from RabbitMQ, report generation, and email report sending.
- ClimateTrackr Client: A React-based web application that interacts with the ClimateTrackr Server to provide user interfaces for administration, data visualization, and user management.
- ClimateTrackr Sensor and ClimateTrackr SensorMicro: Python-based sensors used to gather climate data.
- MySQL Database: A relational database management system used for storing climate data and other relevant information.
- RabbitMQ Server: A message queuing system used for communication between the ClimateTrackr Server and sensors.
